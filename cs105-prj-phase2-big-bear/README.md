# Phase 2

## Usage

Usage is quite simple as regards to running the notebook. As long as the required '.csv' are located in the working directory (identically to the github repo), the notebook could be run immediately. Some thing to note though is that the notebook does generate a new csv file that concatenates the provided '.csv' in the immediate working directory. This was deleted beforehand so we don't duplicate our concatenations. 

Dataset used:

profiles (the crawled datasets)
profiles_irvine.csv (~100 Linkedin profiles in Irvine)
profiles_los_angeles.csv (~100 Linkedin profiles in Los Angeles)
profiles_riverside.csv (~100 Linkedin profiles in Riverside)
profiles_san_diego.csv (~100 Linkedin profiles in San Diego)
profiles_san_francisco.csv (~100 Linkedin profiles in San Francisco)

unemployment information:
Inside Unemployment Rates folder contains unemployment rate city indexing based on each city provided by blms (government website)

Steps:
1. Restart Kernel
2. Ensure 'profiles_california.csv' does not exist yet, if it does delete file
3. Run notebook (give concatenation a second or two before moving on or error may pop-up)
4. Enjoy the EDA!
